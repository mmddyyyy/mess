	<p>“A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings” examines the human response to the fantastic and the magical. Why is the old man in the story both natural and supernatural at once, having the wings of a heavenly messenger but all the frailties of an earthly creature? How do the characters in the story initially react to the presence of the magical and the inexplicable in their midst? Why does the focus of the villagers shift from the old man to the spider-woman? How does her heart-wrenching story with a clear moral lesson contrasts sharply with the obscurity of the old man’s existence and purpose? How is the existence of the magical gradually domesticated in the course of the story? Why does Elisanda become aware of the old man’s divine nature once more only after he has disappeared?

HOW IS THE EXISTANCE OF THE MAGICAL GRADUALLY DOMESTICATED IN THE COURSE OF THE STORY

The old man was sent to better everyone’s lives even if they didn’t know it
Even though he seemingly has no purpose, there is actually a greater purpose that transcends logic, reason religion, superstition. all theories are missing something; nobody can explain the entirety of it
Elisanda’s relationship with him 
Cognative sublime
They avoid him and then end up confrtoning him
Need for coherence
Flood and storm
Transformation
Doesn’t ever fully understand why he was there but beings to accept that there’s no reason or logic or religion or meaning


Elisanda is more patient or more compassionate
Blessing in disguise
He made their son better...house better... not just materially better but made her more grateful compassionate and thoughtful

Through his passivity, mundanity, and inexplicability, the angel reveals human truth and the absurdity of life to the characters in the story.
