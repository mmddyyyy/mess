	 For me, my desktop is kind of a visual mind map or notebook. It has research, screenshots, school work, photoshop files, pictures i’ve taken, etc. None of these files are important enough to get put in a specific folder, yet they still struck me as important for whatever reason when I saved them. This makes my desktop a space of limbo that very rarely gets cleaned or payed attention to. For this project, I wanted to combine the idea of my desktop with ideas of hyperlinks. I created a website with multiple pages that contains the contents of my desktop, connected through hyperlinks. It is kind of an extension of the data diary assignment we had, mixed with the collage assignment. The website itself is simply a compilation and visualization of seemingly unrelated files. However, the one thing they have in common is that they belong on my desktop. There is some order and logic to the way the pages progress, but it is still as chaotic and un ordered as my computer background. I see the final product as a portfolio and also a self portrait.
